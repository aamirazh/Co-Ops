3. Productivity Apps: Learning
    * Language Learning
        * Gamify vocabulary acquisition; create combat system based on combining noun-verb pairs and testing for accurate recall, vocabulary words are items/powers scattered throughout the game.
    * Memorization Apps: Memory Palace, Memory Trainer, FullRecall
    * Bibliographic Archives: Personal Database for managing references, quotes, readings, for collecting and easily organizing and navigating and maintaining a collection of research (excerpts, studies, links, citation engine)
    * Drawing - Guided course based on Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, providing learning tools and activities such as viewfinder, negative drawing, 
    * Mathematics - Gamify a particular piece of algebra.  For example, create a game that walks the player through the process of solving systems of equations, offering players the opportunity to fiddle with a variety of elements so that they can gain feedback and a more intuitive understanding of the process.  Another idea would be to create a game that makes use of elements of geometry in basic player interactions, which could potentially embed or sublimate the learning process.
