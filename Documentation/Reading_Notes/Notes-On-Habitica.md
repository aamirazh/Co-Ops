### Assorted Notes on Habitica

There is an app called Habitica, formerly known as Habit RPG. The website is [here](https://habitica.com). The basic function of the app is to make productivity an RPG game. When you do things on your to-do list, you get gold, achievements, etc. And then you can use that gold to "buy" rewards you set for yourself. For example, let's say you set a bunch of goals to finish at the end of the week. As you knock things off your to-do list, you get gold, and then you use that to "buy" your reward of treating yourself to a movie night. I learned a couple of things from using Habitica as a case study:

* One thing I found interesting was how overt Habitica was in trying to make it feel like a real RPG game. Stuff like its graphics, the gold system, etc - They really do go far in trying to emulate a real RPG.

* The user interface matters a lot in distinguishing a productivity app from others. Just things like smoothness, even small things like quests.

* Keeping a user hooked is also very important. Making them use it the second day is something Habitica is good at.

* Generally Habitica is a prime example of gamifying productivity and keeping users hooked on the game that is their life.
