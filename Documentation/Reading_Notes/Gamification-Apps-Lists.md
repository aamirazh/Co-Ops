### Gamification Apps

We used two "lists" of gamification apps to do research on:

* http://yukaichou.com/lifestyle-gamification/the-top-ten-gamified-productivity-apps/

* http://yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/top-10-gamification-examples-human-race/

The first list is more focused on productivity apps, whereas the second list is more focused on social good gamification (though there are some exceptions). We noticed a couple of themes in these games:

* Quests and Achievements

* Having a point system where you earn points or gold for doing tasks.

* Having attributes or progress bars to show development and progress over time.

* Using gamification to collect data and make users do things to help research or data collection

* Gamifying other contributions from users, like money/donations

* Using gamification to subtly motivate people and make them more relaxed. For example, a long to-do list may make someone stressed out, but presenting those chores in a way that makes them seem doable (i.e. displaying a few to focus on at a time) may be healthier

* Rewarding helping others and doing social good (like recycling) with either artificial rewards (progress meters, leveling up), or even real rewards like money and real life gifts. For example, with a recycling app or another social good app, you can get some kind of support from organizations, whether that's financial or having them sponsor some of their goods to users. Then, you can use that to motivate user contributions.

* Loyalty to the app is important!
