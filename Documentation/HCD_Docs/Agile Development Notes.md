###Agile Development
Agile Development is a product development strategy that emphasizes iterative refinement, cross-disciplinary collaboration, rapid production cycles, and repetitious team-based reflection and review.  Agile Development relies upon the following core values:

####Empiricism
Agile development prefers working on all aspects of product creation simultaneously, and it emphasizes the need to have prototypes working early on in the project.  The development team is always working with somethine tangible: this is necessary if refinement is to occur.
####Emergence
Agile development does not believe in extensive foresight and planning.  Planning and design happen alongside coding and asset creation.  Agile development believes that plans should remain flexible and open to change.  PLANNING is constant in the agile development process, while the plans themselves tend to be rapidly discarded.  Agile's emphasis on emergence allows new features and goals to emerge during the development process, and rather than trying to combat the phenomenon of design drift, agile exploits it.  New ideas emerge as part of the creative process.
####Timeboxing
Agile development relies on the principle of timeboxing to manage the development process.  All goals are broken down into tasks, and all tasks are given a time estimate for their completion.  Developers are pressured to meet milestones and deadlines through the use of sprints and daily scrum meetings.
####Prioritization
Agile development focuses on producing tangible results over perfected design.  It requires developers to constantly re-evaluate their priorities as the project unfolds.  Developers are repeatedly forced to estimate the relative difficulty of development goals and to plan the material steps required to reach these goals.
####Self-Organization
Each team member is treated as a locus of self-organization within the project.  They are each given creative agency and are each a source of potential emergent refinement or innovation.  They are expected to fulfill their responsibilities and meet deadlines on an independent level, and collectively they are expected to manage and communicate the project's changing requirements.


###Product Backlog
Agile development relies upon a living document called the product backlog.  The product backlog is a list of the valued features of the end-product.  These features are arranged and prioritized based upon the estimated value of and difficulty in developing them.  The product backlog forms the basis for measuring development progress.

###Sprints
At the beginning of each sprint, the team meets and selects which features they intend to develop for that sprint.  Each sprint will focus on a specific feature or set of features, and this goal will not be changed until the end of the sprint.  The sprint represents one full development cycle, with planning, design, code, asset creation, and integration all factored in.  Ideally, the product should be in a shippable state at the end of each sprint.  The team needs enough information at the beginning of each sprint to make an educated guess about how much effort it will take to implement a feature.  Once the team has settled on their prioritized features, they should proceed to break down the development requirements step-by-step in order to construct a clear timeline.  They should create milestones and deadlines for the sprint, and then they need to create a Task Board for the sprint.

###Task Board
The task board is the living document of the sprint cycle.  It is a public document that the team maintains as a group and that keeps the team on track.  Developers may add tasks to the Task Board and they may mark tasks as having been completed.  The task board will grow and shrink throughout the sprint.

###Daily Scrum
The daily scrum is a 15 minute meeting in which each developer reports on their progress.  The team may add tasks to the Task Board, make requests, identify impediments.  The main function of the daily scrum is to ensure that communication remains flowing and the development process remains integrated.  Additionally, the team will refine its projected deadlines and time estimates each day to reflect the insights gained during the development process and to make a change in plans if neccessary.
