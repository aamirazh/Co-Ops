## Executive Summary

### Title: Co-Ops

### Genre: Gamified Productivity App

### Version: 1.0

### The Big Idea

The idea of Co-Ops is to allow someone to have the pressure of developing a skill, hobby, or habit with someone else, along with the documentation, reward system, and utility of doing it on a gamified productivity app.

### Platforms

Android.

### Technology

Developed using Unity Engine.

### Target Audience

The average person trying to start exercising, develop a skill or hobby like playing the violin, or anything, and needs accountability for it. No specific targeted audience.

### Key Features and Unique Selling Points

* Accountability by pursuing development with someone else.

* Social aspect of doing an activity with a friend, instead of using the app alone.

* Keeps track of your goals and motivates you to reach them.

* Documents every time you flake on your friend, or if you consistently follow through on practices and plans, so you can build up a "record".

* Keeps the user coming back using reminders, a reward system, and a medal system where they earn medals for being consistent.

### Marketing Summary

Market to a select amount of Duke students for feedback. App is not planned to be released or marketed widely.

## Game Design Document

### Product Overview

This app is a productivity app where you can set goals for yourself and see statistics on how well you followed through on them.

### The Core Concept

The app will allow you to add a certain "skills" to your menu. For each skill, you can invite a friend to pursue practicing it with you, then set goals for yourself, frequency of practice, and so on. Then, it will respond by checking with your partner if you are keeping up with practices, will provide statistics and documentation to show progress, and reinforce goals using a reward system to motivate the user.

For example, if a user wants to start running, they can create a new "habit" to practice with a friend of theirs. They can set it to practicing 3 days a week, and having a milestone of running a mile in in 10 minutes, then 9 minutes, and so on. Inside the app, they can schedule "running appointments" or times with their friend(s). The app, after each appointment, will notify the user and their friend, asking for confirmation that it was successful. If one of the friends decides to flake on it, the other can take note of that and the app will document it. Over time, the app will keep track of if milestones/goals are reached, as well as show statistics about how consistent someone is about developing their skill or habit. It will also give rewards for consistency, potentially awarding badges or some kind of recognition or reputation for being consistent and being a good partner to develop a habit with.

### Interface

Exact details may be subject to change. As of now, there will be a side-menu where you can choose a certain skill or habit you are developing, or make a new one. Once you click on one, it will take you to a screen where you can select a couple of sub-menus: Statistics and Progress, Set New Goals and Settings, and Social. Each of these submenus is self-explanatory, except for social. Social will be the submenu you select to see your partner or group's progress, confirm that they are practicing, and potentially communicate with the other people doing this project with you.

When making a new skill, it will ask a few preliminary questions:

* Who do you want to develop this skill with, if at all? (enter username or email)

* How often do you want to practice?

* What are a few milestones and goals you want to outline?

### Development Summary

This game will be developed over 2 weeks, from Monday 30th to February 12th, so it will start out very basic. Then, starting the third week (February 13th to February 19th), we will be allowing people to test the app and give feedback. Then, potentially, after a month or two we will return to developing the app and improving based off feedback.

### Localization

As of now, there are no plans to localize. We are planning on only marketing this for beta testing to a few students at Duke University, but we have no plans to release explicitly. The app will start out only having an English option and will not be abstracted internationally yet.

### Conclusion

Overall, this game is meant to be a productivity and habit development app that you can use, ideally with other friends. We want users to have the social benefit and accountability of pursuing a habit or hobby with other people, but also give them the structure, documentation, and motivation that an app can give with that. We want to combine these two to make the ideal experience when a user wants to develop a skill or practice something.

However, since it will be developed over so little time, it will mostly be a skeleton app and concept design, and only go so far to beta testing. Plans to continue developing will be decided post-beta-testing.
