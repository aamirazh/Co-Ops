Excerpt from The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Design that explains how to write an executive summary and a game design document.

The executive summary is the pitch.  It’s where you condense the game design document for the purpose of efficiently communicating your ideas to hitherto uninvolved parties.
“ THE ONE-SHEET
	The one-sheet, also called the Executive Summary, is upfront in your design document.  You may even find that you create a separate one-sheet or executive summary document of your game.  The reasons for this are numerous.  First, this is a fast way to pitch the game to busy decision-makers.  Secondly, it allows everyone else who might be interested, or have input, to see an encapsulation of your vision.  Perhaps most important, it forces you to figure out exactly what is the core game-play experience you’re creating.
	Often, we’ll start by trying to write the manual.  If you can do this, and communicate all of the ideas that you hope to achieve in the game, then chances are good that your design is solid.  You’ll find that the longer and more detailed the document gets early on in the process, the more ‘idea-drift’ you are likely to experience.  (A one-sheet can be anywhere from one to five pages in length.  Go figure).
	So start by trying to write the one-sheet.  The elements of the one-sheet are as follows:
	TITLE:
	If you are not yet settled on a title, it is a good idea to include (working title) in parenthesis.  Spend some time on this and really think it through, because your title is your opening salvo….
	GENRE:
	Listing genre is important, because, like film studios, developers often have a slot to fill, and they are looking for a specific type of game, or gameplay.
	VERSION:
	Usually, we’ll put a version number on our document, but not a date.  Why? Anything with a date has a shelf life attached to it. If you submit a document in January, and it is reviewed by a publisher in May, it doesn’t feel as fresh and new when a decision maker reads it.
	THE BIG IDEA:
	Put a brief synopsis of your content (story, character, worlds) and your gameplay here.  In one or two paragraphs, describe the essence of the game experience.
	CATEGORY:
	Similar to genre, here go ahead and list a few games that compare to your title…  If you have a unique gameplay or content ‘hook,’ this is where you should feature it…  One final note: Never badmouth another game in an attempt to build up your own.  Always make favorable comparisons, never negative ones. 
	PLATFORMS:
	Note that each time you list a potential platform for your game, you will need to explain why it is important to release the game for that platform.
	LICENSE:
	Remember that your reader is looking for more than a one-shot deal.  Think about how can your game be more than a game.
	PLAY MECHANIC:
	This is the core gameplay and control of the game… The play mechanic describes how the player interacts with the gaming experience, and how and why it will be compelling and fun for him to do so.
	TECHNOLOGY:
	Provide a summary of the technology you plan to use for the game.  If you are using middleware, list the engine and tools that will be employed.  If the engine is proprietary, list its key features.  Note that there are separate documents that will have to be included from the engineering team that will fully detail the technology for the game (often called TDR—Technical Design Review).
	TARGET AUDIENCE:
	Who do you expect to play this game and why?  You can describe a specific demographic, but it is more helpful to describe a type of gamer.
	KEY FEATURS—USPS (UNIQUE SELLING POINTS)
	Here, list the key elements of your game that make it unique.  Think of these as the bullet points that would be listed on the back of the box.  Keep this to about four to six features.  You can describe more later in the document if you need to; for now, you are hitting the high points.
	MARKETING SUMMARY:
	This is a quick list of why this game will do well in the marketplace when compared to others.  Also, think of “hooks” that marketing people can get excited about early on, they—more than almost anyone else—determine the viability of your project.  If marketing doesn’t think they can sell your game, it doesn’t matter how groundbreaking you are, how many champions you at the publisher, or how cool the lead character is.  You’re dead in the water if marketing is against it.
	Describe how the player will control the game and advance… As with the big idea, describe the core mechanics in as straightforward a manner as possible.”

Open Quote for High Level Design Document
“THE HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN DOCUMENT”
	Now we are into the meat of the document.  Everything that has come before should be no more than three to five pages in length (and separate it from the rest of the document so that, if need be, it can be a ‘leave behind’ that is independent from the rest of the High-level Document).  As we move beyond the one-sheet, we start filling in the details, and providing more specifics about the envisioned game we want to create.

	PRODUCT OVERVIEW:
	Reintroduce your core game concept, this time fleshing it out.  If you have a lead character, this is also the time to start filling in their details.

	THE CORE CONCEPT:
	Describe the main elements of the game.  Include any and all of the following things that are relevant to your title, but don’t extensively detail them here (that will come later).  Instead, show each of these elements incorporates into the larger gameplay experience:
•	Characters (Including the PC-Player Character)
•	Worlds
•	Gameplay
•	Combat
•	Hand to hand
•	Weapons
•	Movement
•	Interactions
•	Vehicles
•	Story
•	Realism Versus Fantasy
•	Controls
•	Etc.
PLAYER CHARACTER
Now describe the player character in detail, and their journey through the game.  Note that if you have more than one character that the player will control, describe them all here.  What do you hope to accomplish in the relationship between the player and their character?  How will you achieve this?
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF GAMEPLAY, AKA THE ‘GRABBER’
In this section, take a key set piece from the game, and describe it as if you were telling a story.  Often we’ll put the player-controlled actions in a different font, or bold them, to make them stand out from wat the player is seeing on the screen.  What you want to impart is the interaction/reaction dynamic (cause/effect) of the game, and how that manifests itself on screen.
The Grabber is also referred to as the hook.  By that, we mean something that is intended to hook (or grab) your audience’s (or reader’s) imagination.  This is where a cool, over-the-top element or set piece from your game should go.
STORY:
Here you provide a beat sheet of story and how it integrates with thte key game-play.  Detail the story enhances the experience.  Key off the moments you explored in the Grabber.
INTERFACE:
Describe the elements of the interface: Are they configurable by the player?  Is the interface intuitive and easy to use?
OBSTACLES:
List the main obstacles that the player as the hero must overcome to win the game.
	These can include:
•	Enemies

GAME SHELL (FRONT END)
Detail the game shell (start screen, load screen):
	Options – List the options available to the player (widescreen, sound, autosave, etc.)
	Load/Save – Describe the details of saving and loading a game.

LEVELS
In this part of the document, create a list of levels of the game.  Include how the player progresses from one level to another.

DEVELOPMENT SUMMARY
If you are able, this is where you want to put a summary of the development process needed to complete the game.  The summary would include things like:
•	Preliminary schedule
•	Budget
•	Engineering acquisitions and schedules
•	Personnel bios and resumes (of core team members)
