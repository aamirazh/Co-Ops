### Aamir/Professor Duvall Weekly Meeting: 01/26/2017

* We're also learning different toolsets/platforms instead of trying to focus on design and user experience
* * Should we be focusing so much on toolsets rather than presentation?

* We can use unity for all 3 platforms (mobile, web, desktop app)

###### Gamification App
* Include single player option for app first

* Start with single player, then we can do 2 player version if we have time, then n players, etc

* Need something to get people to use the app past the first day
* * positive reinforcement, streaks

* Accommodating different "types" of people/different focuses: trying something new, consistency, checking other people/encouragers

* Making the achievement system social/reputation oriented instead of just giving a private gold star

###### Documentation and Feedback
* Maybe make documentation separate from source code?

* Target friends based off background/knowledge, their interests, how useful/fun the app/game would be for them

* * Minimum of 5 feedbackers, no more than 10
